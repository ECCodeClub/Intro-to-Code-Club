**Intro Activity**

* Clone the repo 

First of all, you will need to clone the repo onto your laptop. You can do this through the GitHub desktop client or by clicking Clone on this page.

* Introduce yourself 

Your task is to make a small HTML page to introduce yourself to the other members of Code Club. You can put whatever you want on there, and style it however you want (If you know CSS, I encourage you to use it).
Name the HTML file 'yourname'.html.

* Create a commit 

From the Github app, create a commit of the changes you have made to the repo.
Be sure to give your commit an appropriate title and message.
Note: This does not upload anything or change the repo on GitHub at all.

* Push your changes 

Using the Github app, push your commit to the repo.

* Pull new commits

When you are done, you can sync your repo using the app to see the commits other people have made.
